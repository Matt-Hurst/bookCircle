# Book Circle
Book Circle allows you to store your bookshelf virtually, keeping track of every book you've read, your thoughts on the book and whether you have a physical copy to hand to lend to friends. Set a target for books to read in a year and keep track with the apps handy totalizer. Add your friends and snoop through their bookshelves and don't forget to request to borrow any books that leap out at you.
